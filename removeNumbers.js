const word = `Intro
0:00
about us Pages or kinda
0:04
they fly against everything marketing
0:06
experts say to do on any other web page
0:09
they're self-indulgent they're braggy
0:11
and they make you as the business the
0:14
hero when everyone knows that should be
0:16
all about your customer right actually
0:19
in this case maybe not I know not the
0:22
advice that I thought I'd be giving and
0:24
it kind of goes against advice that I've
0:26
given in the past but I've discovered
0:29
something new here and I can't wait to
0:32
share it with you and because I know it
0:34
helps I'll be showing you lots of
0:35
examples of everything that we go over
0:37
so that you can see it in action so why
0:41
is your about us page so important
About Page Analytics
0:43
anyway they're almost always among the
0:45
very most top visited pages on any site
0:48
if you look at analytics this is a page
0:50
on the path toward conversion this is
0:52
Andy crestadina co-founder of orbit
0:54
media right here in Chicago and one of
0:57
my personal web marketing mentors from
0:59
way back he's got an amazingly simple
1:02
framework that any business can use for
1:04
the about us page to connect more with
1:07
your prospects and really make them see
1:09
you as the human based business that
1:11
they want to work with over anyone else
1:14
with everything going on in the world
1:16
trust is at an all-time low we don't
1:18
trust the news we really don't trust
1:21
politicians and when people generally
1:23
think they're being lied to from every
1:25
angle that negative feeling can transfer
1:28
over to other things too like businesses
1:31
we may want to work with or products
1:33
that we may want to buy when distrust is
1:36
the new default how can your about page
1:39
actually help you inject some much
1:40
needed trust back into your website and
1:43
your business itself to answer that
Why People Visit Your About Page
1:46
you've got to know why people are going
1:47
to your about page to begin with they're
1:50
going for a few things visitors want to
1:52
feel a connection to a brand may not be
1:54
obvious but some of the key questions
1:56
people have about any business are who
1:59
are you why did you start this yeah they
2:01
want to see for themselves that there
2:03
are real human beings behind the brand
2:05
because we humans like buying from
2:08
people more than we like buying from
2:10
companies and whether they know it
2:12
consciously or not they want to feel
2:15
connected to what you stand for and this
2:18
isn't new AG sending Good Vibes out into
2:20
the universe stuff either nope this is
2:23
backed up by data 36 000 people were
2:26
surveyed and turns out that 58 of them
2:29
choose businesses they want to work with
2:31
or buy from based on the connection they
2:34
feel to their beliefs and values so yeah
2:37
this page does need to be a little
2:39
different from the rest of your website
2:41
it's an opportunity to really break a
2:43
rule that applies to most web pages
The French Test
2:45
which is don't make it too much about
2:47
yourself
2:48
it's some websites talk too much about
2:50
the brand and they failed a French test
2:53
we love us we we which is failing the
2:56
French test it's a joke you know you
2:58
know don't wee wee all over your website
2:59
we will
3:00
we might just wanna powder my nose but
3:03
the about page is supposed to fail the
3:04
French test be a little bit
3:06
self-indulgent like they're like you
3:08
know make it long go into those values
3:09
and the the why tell the why why does
3:12
this company exist they're fun to write
3:14
they're an exception they're very
3:16
powerful and they're a chance for that
3:18
person to make a connection with the
3:19
humans on the other side of this this
3:21
screen so what's the easiest way for
3:23
anyone watching this to create that kind
3:25
of about page that's going to connect
3:27
like that that you're talking about so
3:29
if you make a mini framework and we all
3:30
love Frameworks for what should be
3:32
included in the about us page I'm going
3:34
to give you seven quick things one is
3:36
that there's a story stories have
3:37
beginning middle and end and stories
3:39
leverage a type of human psychology that
3:41
makes them easy to connect with it's a
3:43
fundamental way in which Humanity
3:45
understands reality our brains like
Story
3:48
stories because they cut through
3:49
distractions and according to Forbes
3:52
storytelling is not only going to help
3:54
your visitors look more favorably at
3:56
your business it can also be up to 22
3:59
times more memorable than fact salon and
4:01
if the idea of telling a story sounds
4:03
complicated or like how am I supposed to
4:06
tell a story about my business don't
4:09
worry it's about to get super clear
4:10
because the rest of this framework
4:12
breaks it all out into simple bite-sized
4:15
chunks starting with what every good
4:17
story needs and that's characters AKA
4:21
people stories have characters and about
4:23
us picture to have people the founders
Characters
4:25
or the leadership or visuals of their
4:27
faces one of the most common mistakes on
4:28
an about page is that it lacks
4:30
characters or people there's no Humanity
4:32
the about page is sort of regurgitating
4:34
what was on the home page which is just
4:36
the business category about us these are
4:39
our Solutions these are our services
4:41
these are our products that's not
4:43
actually about you that's about what the
4:45
company does so I saw one today it's an
4:49
about us page that fails to mention
4:51
anybody that doesn't talk about when the
4:54
company was started it doesn't talk
4:55
about why the company exists what was
4:58
missing from the marketplace that
4:59
created the need for this company need
5:01
to come into existence that's what
5:03
that's what a good about page does so
5:04
introduce your key team members or just
5:07
you great introduce yourself all of
5:10
these about us page examples do a great
5:12
job using images of the people behind
5:15
the brand so this just helps your site
5:18
visitors see that you're real whether
5:20
you're a big team or a one-person show
Conflict
5:23
and next we have conflict what was the
5:26
failure in the marketplace that forced
5:29
us to create this business what problem
5:31
is it solving there was a problem and we
5:34
care so we're there to fix it there's a
5:37
dragon and it's bad so we're there to
5:39
fight it and here are a few ways that
5:41
you can fight those dragons on your
5:43
about page first check out this example
5:46
from New Era they use stats to show that
5:49
a big problem exists then they go on to
5:52
personalize it with an origin story of
5:54
sorts something that they fight against
5:56
or you could have even more fun with the
5:58
approach used by freshdesk so they just
6:01
use a simply styled timeline to show
6:04
that a bad customer experience sparked
6:07
the idea for the company then the rest
6:10
was history but the idea of fighting off
6:12
metaphorical dragons is really just one
6:15
way of using conflict the other type of
Resolution
6:17
conflict is a simpler one it's just the
6:19
passion of the founders our company is
6:20
kind of like that I didn't want to do
6:22
anything else this is all I wanted to do
6:23
I'm just a bit obsessed with the
6:24
intersection between Art and Science and
6:27
creative and Technical that was the
6:28
conflict for me is that I would not have
6:30
been satisfied doing anything else
6:31
resolution what is the outcome of this
6:34
work what is the impact of this work how
6:37
does it make a difference what is the
6:38
sort of emotional connection that the
6:40
reader can have to the results that
6:43
connect to the purpose so every story
6:45
has a resolution the resolution is kind
6:47
of the moment you know the the new Bliss
6:49
uh you might call it and you can show
6:52
that new Bliss in a few ways so check
6:54
out this about page from Aero payments
6:57
they show their results in the form of
6:59
social proof and evidence that their
7:01
methods work followed by showing how
7:04
they get those results by doing more
7:07
than the other guys so next up we have
Future
7:09
something that most about Pages skip
7:11
altogether and that's to briefly touch
7:14
on where you're going next Rose
7:17
where we're going we don't need roads
7:20
think of this like a sequel what's the
7:23
vision a sequel element would be like uh
7:25
in a cliffhanger ending what do we
7:27
believe will happen in the future what
7:30
is the position of this brand in the
7:32
context of going forward so this is
7:35
something that uh is sort of easy to do
7:38
even with a simple statement uh it helps
7:40
people see that you're you're thinking
7:43
bigger than just this current moment it
7:45
gives them something else that's
7:46
memorable about your values and this
7:49
doesn't need to be its own section or
7:50
anything it can just be mentioned toward
7:52
the end of your page along with any of
7:55
the other story elements that Andy's
7:56
mentioned so far there's no rules for
7:58
this stuff I've seen very successful
8:00
pages that are very light on text but
8:02
heavy on video I've seen very successful
8:04
pages that have no video but a super
8:06
super long story I've seen single
8:08
paragraphs where each sentence sort of
8:11
checks a box on those seven things you
8:13
can actually make them very condensed
8:15
sometimes but still impactful still
8:16
addressing still including the elements
8:18
but we're not done yet so what comes
8:20
next Andy I read stories to a
8:22
four-year-old every night the ones that
8:23
she loves are the ones that have
8:24
dialogue people talking to each other
8:27
quotation marks the most powerful key on
8:29
your keyboard put something in quotes
8:30
and it's just instantly more credible
8:31
and more compelling so dialogue really
8:34
hearing the voice of the brand literally
8:36
hearing the voice of the brand written
8:38
as text or in video a great format for
8:41
that is video because it's going to let
8:43
them you know they're going to see your
8:44
face and hear your tone of voice and
8:46
when the words you speak and the
8:48
expression on your face and hands and
8:50
the tone of voice you use when those
8:52
three things align then you're credible
8:54
so video is a super super powerful
8:56
format for about us pages and then
8:58
finally the setting what is the context
9:01
what is the business what is the
9:02
category where are we in the world
9:04
people want to know that right it's an
9:07
indication of spam if you cannot tell
9:09
where that business is so picture the
9:12
exterior you know just uh a map of
9:14
locations some visual ideally it's
9:16
visual again that shows uh where this
9:19
company is and that's just your about us
9:22
page but I've got the complete framework
9:24

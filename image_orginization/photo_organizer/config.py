# üéØ MAIN EXECUTION MODES
#
# Choose ONE primary mode (set only ONE to True):

DEFAULT_MODE_NAME_ONLY = False  # SEO-optimized AI naming (most efficient)
DEFAULT_AI_CLASSIFY = True  # Standard AI classification (balanced)
DEFAULT_ASSIGN_SINGLETONS = False  # Advanced mode with AI matching (experimental)

# Mode descriptions:
# - NAME_ONLY: Flattens all images, creates collages, AI names each uniquely
# Output: Every image gets unique SEO filename
# Cost: ~$0.06 for 562 images (12 API calls)
# Use: When you want SEO names and trust clustering
#
# - AI_CLASSIFY: Standard classification by cluster
# Output: Images grouped by type with semantic variations
# Cost: ~$1.44 for 562 images (287 API calls)
# Use: Default recommended mode
#
# - ASSIGN_SINGLETONS: Advanced matching of uncertain items
# Output: Merges singletons into confident clusters
# Cost: Higher (classification + matching)
# Use: When you have many singletons to consolidate

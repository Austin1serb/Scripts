            "- Return ONLY the requested fields: id, label, confidence, descriptor\n"

            "- Consider the project TYPE and concrete FINISH when classifying\n\n"

            "- Take into account the lighting, weather conditions, specific concrete finish and context of the photo\n"
            "- High confidence (0.85-1.0): Clear view, unmistakable identification\n"
            "- Medium confidence (0.65-0.84): Likely correct, some ambiguity\n"
            "- Low confidence (<0.65): Uncertain, use 'unknown' label\n\n"
            "IMPORTANT DISTINCTIONS:\n"
            "- DRIVEWAYS: Vehicle access, typically residential or commercial parking areas\n"
            "- PATIOS: Outdoor living spaces, entertainment areas, adjacent to homes\n"
            "- WALKWAYS: Pedestrian paths connecting areas, narrower than driveways, sometimes called pathways/paths\n"
            "- SIDEWALKS: Public or property-edge pedestrian paths, typically along streets\n"
            "- STEPS: Elevation changes, staircases, porch steps\n"
            "- SLABS: Large flat surfaces (garage floors, shed foundations, house slabs)\n\n"
            "FINISH TYPES:\n"
            "- STAMPED: Textured patterns (stone, brick, wood grain impressions)\n"
            "- EXPOSED AGGREGATE: Visible decorative stones/pebbles in surface\n"
            "- BROOM FINISH: Textured with broom strokes for traction (common on driveways)\n"
            "- SMOOTH/TROWELED: Plain finished surface\n\n"
            "CLASSIFICATION PRIORITY:\n"
            "1. If stamped pattern visible â†’ use 'stamped-concrete-[type]'\n"
            "2. If exposed aggregate visible â†’ use 'exposed-aggregate-[type]'\n"
            "3. If broom finish visible â†’ use 'broom-finish-[type]'\n"
            "4. Otherwise â†’ use standard 'concrete-[type]'\n"
            "5. For repairs/resurfacing â†’ look for patches, cracks, overlays\n\n"

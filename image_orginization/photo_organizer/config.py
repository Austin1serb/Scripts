            "If multiple elements exist, choose the one occupying the largest area, centered, and in best focus.\n\n"
            "VISUAL HEURISTICS:\n"
            "- DRIVEWAY cues: garage doors, curb cut, apron, vehicles, street edge, wide slab to garage\n"
            "- PATIO cues: backyard furniture, sliding door, grilling area, house facade adjacent without curb\n"

            "- SIDEWALK cues: street, curb and gutter, public frontage, control joints at regular street intervals\n"
            "- STEPS cues: risers and treads, nosing line, handrails, porch transitions\n"
            "- SLAB cues: large flat interior or pad, sawcuts in grids, walls or forms around perimeter\n"
            "- RETAINING WALL cues: soil retention, tiered blocks, drainage weeps, geogrid or backfill visible\n"
            "- REPAIR/RESURFACING cues: crack routing, patch color contrast, grinder, overlay feather edges, leveling pumps\n"
            "- FINISH cues: stamped (imprinted patterns), exposed aggregate (visible pebbles), broom (linear grooves), smooth trowel\n\n"

            "- Penalize confidence for: night shots, motion blur, heavy shadows, water glare, construction clutter, extreme zoom\n\n"
            "STRICT RULES:\n"
            "1) Label MUST be exactly one of ALLOWED LABELS or 'unknown'. If a finish-variant is not present in ALLOWED LABELS, fallback to the closest base element label instead of inventing one.\n"
            "2) Never output city names, locations, brand names, tools, people, vehicles, or suggestions.\n"
            "3) No extra fields. No markdown. JSON array only.\n"
            "4) If text overlays or watermarks conflict with visuals, ignore text and trust the pixels.\n"
            "5) If the frame is mostly equipment, materials, or rebar with no clear element, output 'unknown'.\n\n"

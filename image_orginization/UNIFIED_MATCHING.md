# Unified Matching: Simplified Singleton + hash_only Cluster Merging

## Overview

**Unified Matching** is a simplified approach to cluster assignment that treats **singletons** and **hash_only clusters** identically. Both are considered "uncertain" items that need validation and should be compared against all "confident" clusters to find the best match.

This replaces the previous "Cascading Classification" approach with a cleaner, more intuitive workflow.

---

## The Problem

After initial clustering (GPS, time, filename, hash), we end up with:

1. **Confident Clusters** (60 clusters)
   - **GPS clusters**: Photos from same GPS coordinates → same location (100% confident)
   - **Time+Filename+Hash clusters**: Same day + similar name + visual match → same job (95% confident)
   - **Filename+Hash clusters**: Similar name + visual match → likely same job (85% confident)

2. **Uncertain Items** (~62 items)
   - **Singletons (47)**: Single photos that didn't cluster with anything
   - **hash_only clusters (15)**: 2-3 photos grouped only by visual similarity (no GPS, no time, weak filename)

**Key Insight**: Singletons and hash_only clusters have the same problem → they need validation!

- A singleton might belong to a GPS cluster (just a delayed photo)
- A hash_only cluster might actually be 2-3 different driveways that look similar
- Both need to be compared against confident clusters to find their true home

---

## The Solution: Unified Matching

**Treat singletons and hash_only clusters the same:**

```
Step 1: Separate clusters
├─ Confident: GPS/Time/Filename clusters (already correct)
└─ Uncertain: Singletons + hash_only clusters (need validation)

Step 2: Classify confident clusters
└─ Get labels for all confident clusters

Step 3: Match uncertain items
└─ Compare each uncertain item against ALL confident clusters
   ├─ Use best example image from each cluster
   ├─ Create collage of all confident clusters
   └─ AI decides: merge or stay separate

Step 4: Classify remaining
└─ Classify any unmatched uncertain items
```

---

## How It Works

### 1. Confident vs Uncertain Separation

```python
CONFIDENT_STRATEGIES = [
    "gps_location",      # GPS-based (high confidence)
    "time+filename+hash", # Time + filename + visual
    "filename+hash",     # Filename + visual
]

UNCERTAIN_STRATEGIES = [
    "hash_only",         # Visual only (needs validation)
]

# Singletons (count == 1) are ALWAYS uncertain, regardless of strategy
```

### 2. Best Example Selection

For each cluster (confident or uncertain), select the best representative image:

```python
def get_best_example(group: List[Item]) -> Item:
    """
    1. Prefer GPS-tagged photos (most reliable)
    2. Prefer middle by timestamp (most representative)
    3. Fallback to largest file size
    """
```

### 3. Collage Comparison

Create a **single collage** of all confident clusters:

```
Collage:
[Cluster 5: GPS, "driveway-repair"]
[Cluster 8: Time, "roof-replacement"]
[Cluster 12: Filename, "siding-repair"]
... (all 60 confident clusters)

Compare uncertain item against this collage:
- Singleton #91 → Does it match any of the 60 clusters?
- hash_only cluster #23 → Does it belong to any of the 60 clusters?
```

### 4. AI Prompt

```
You are comparing an uncertain photo/cluster against known confident clusters.

CONFIDENT CLUSTERS (labeled collage):
This collage shows 60 confident clusters with their labels.

UNCERTAIN ITEM:
Below is an uncertain item (ID: 91) that needs matching.

Does this uncertain item belong to any of the confident clusters in the collage?
Consider: same physical location, same materials, same surroundings, distinct features.

If it matches, return the cluster_id and confidence (0.0-1.0).
If no match, return cluster_id: -1 and confidence: 0.0.
Provide a brief reason for your decision.
```

### 5. AI Response

```json
{
  "cluster_id": 5,
  "confidence": 0.85,
  "reason": "Same driveway, visible in background features"
}
```

or

```json
{
  "cluster_id": -1,
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "reason": "Different location, no matching surroundings"
}
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Simplicity**

**Before (Cascading):**
- Different logic for singletons vs hash_only clusters
- Complex label-guided filtering
- Multiple API call patterns

**After (Unified):**
- Same logic for both (they're both "uncertain")
- One collage, one comparison pattern
- Simple and consistent

### 2. **Efficiency**

**API Calls:**
```
62 uncertain items × 1 comparison each = 62 API calls
(vs. ~200 calls to classify each image individually)
```

**One Collage:**
- Create collage of all confident clusters (one-time operation)
- Reuse for all uncertain items
- No need to recreate for each comparison

### 3. **Accuracy**

**Compare Against ALL Clusters:**
- No `MAX_CLUSTERS_PER_CALL` limitation (was 10)
- See all 60 confident clusters at once
- Make best decision based on full context

**Use Best Examples:**
- `get_best_example()` for all comparisons
- GPS-tagged photos preferred
- Temporal middle images prioritized

### 4. **Respect Clustering Logic**

**High-Confidence Clusters = Trusted:**
- GPS clusters: Same coordinates = same location → Never re-cluster
- Time+Filename: Same day + similar name = same job → Never re-cluster
- Filename+Hash: Similar name + visual = same job → Never re-cluster

**Low-Confidence Items = Needs Validation:**
- hash_only: Only visual similarity → Could be different locations
- Singletons: Didn't cluster with anything → Might belong somewhere

## Configuration

### Enable/Disable

```python
# In config.py
ENABLE_UNIFIED_MATCHING = True  # Use unified matching
```

### Strategy Definitions

```python
CONFIDENT_STRATEGIES = [
    "gps_location",      # High confidence
    "time+filename+hash",
    "filename+hash",
]

UNCERTAIN_STRATEGIES = [
    "hash_only",         # Low confidence, needs validation
]
```

### CLI Argument

```bash
python -m photo_organizer.cli run \
  --input "/path/to/photos" \
  --classify \
  --assign-singletons  # Enables unified matching
```

---

## Expected Results

### Before (No Matching)

```
112 clusters total:
- 60 high-confidence (GPS/Time/Filename)
- 15 hash_only (2-3 images each)
- 47 singletons (1 image each)

Result: 112 folders, many tiny 1-2 image folders
```

### After (With Unified Matching)

```
~70 clusters total:
- 60 high-confidence (now include matched items)
- ~5 hash_only (unmatched, stay separate)
- ~5 singletons (unmatched, stay separate)

Result: 70 folders, fewer tiny folders, better consolidation
```

### API Cost

```
Without unified matching:
- 112 cluster classifications = 112 API calls

With unified matching:
- 60 confident cluster classifications = 60 calls
- 62 uncertain item matches = 62 calls
- ~5 remaining classifications = 5 calls
- Total: 127 calls

Trade-off: +15 calls (~13% more), but MUCH better accuracy
```

## Testing

Test file: `tests/test_5_classification_ai.py`

**Test Cases:**
1. ✅ Singleton matches GPS cluster
2. ✅ hash_only cluster matches Time cluster
3. ✅ Singleton doesn't match anything (stays separate)
4. ✅ hash_only cluster doesn't match (stays separate)
5. ✅ Multiple uncertain items match same confident cluster

**Output:**
- API call statistics
- Match results with confidence scores
- Cost comparison (individual vs unified)

## Comparison: Cascading vs Unified

| Feature | Cascading Classification | Unified Matching |
|---------|-------------------------|------------------|
| **Singletons** | Special logic | Treated as uncertain |
| **hash_only** | Not handled | Treated as uncertain |
| **Comparison** | Label-guided filtering | Direct collage comparison |
| **Complexity** | 5 phases, complex logic | 3 phases, simple logic |
| **API Calls** | ~110 calls | ~127 calls (+15%) |
| **Accuracy** | Good for singletons | Great for all uncertain items |
| **Code** | 140 lines | 80 lines |

---

## Migration from Cascading

### What Changed

1. **Removed:**
   - Label-guided singleton filtering
   - Separate singleton assignment logic
   - Complex cascading flow

2. **Added:**
   - Unified uncertain item matching
   - `separate_confident_uncertain_clusters()`
   - `apply_matches_to_groups()`

3. **Simplified:**
   - One matching function for all uncertain items
   - Consistent API call pattern
   - Easier to understand and maintain

### Backwards Compatibility

```python
# Old flag still works
ENABLE_CASCADING_CLASSIFICATION = True  # Ignored if ENABLE_UNIFIED_MATCHING = True

# New flag takes precedence
ENABLE_UNIFIED_MATCHING = True  # Overrides cascading if enabled
```

---

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Batching (Optional)

Currently: 62 individual API calls for uncertain items

**Possible optimization:**
```python
# Batch uncertain items (10 per call)
for batch in batches_of(uncertain_items, 10):
    compare_batch_against_collage(batch, confident_collage)
```

Trade-off: 7 calls vs 62 calls, but slightly less accurate

### 2. Confidence Threshold

```python
# Only merge if confidence > threshold
if confidence > 0.7:
    merge_into_cluster(uncertain_item, target_cluster)
else:
    keep_separate(uncertain_item)
```

### 3. Multi-Level Matching

```python
# Try confident clusters first, then uncertain-to-uncertain
Step 1: Match uncertain → confident
Step 2: Match remaining uncertain → other uncertain
```

---

## Summary

**Unified Matching** simplifies the photo organization pipeline by treating singletons and hash_only clusters identically. Both are "uncertain" items that need validation, and both benefit from comparing against all confident clusters using a single collage.

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ Simpler code (80 lines vs 140)
- ✅ Better accuracy (all uncertain items validated)
- ✅ Fewer folders (better consolidation)
- ✅ Respects clustering logic (confident = trusted)

**Trade-off:**
- +15 API calls (~13% more cost)
- But significantly better results!

2. `openai_classifier.py` - Added unified matching functions
3. `schemas.py` - Added uncertain match schema
4. `cli.py` - Updated to use unified matching flow
